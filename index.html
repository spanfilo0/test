          The main language of the Ancient Pre-Columbian Tarascan State is slowly perishing.
          But, Why?

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        Founded in the early 14th Century, the Tarascan State was one of the major empires of the Pre-Columbian Era.
        The inhabitants spoke the primary language, Purepecha, and through this, the traditions were passed on from one generation to the next.
        After hearing of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Tarascan ruler, Cazonci Tangaxuan II, surrendered to the Spanish.
        Years after, their rule would still be in place and many Purepechas were forced to forget their old culture and learn a new language with new traditions.
        Many people today still feel ashamed of their culture after so many years of opression, but others are trying to connect to their roots.

         Fighting For Our Voice

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
        Opression from the Spanish and later from the modern Mexican State had left a gaping hole in the Purepecha culture. 
        Many fled to bigger cities or the U.S for another life, leaving their opressed one behind and returning with a "modern" lifestyle.
        In Cheran, Michoacan, there is a different story. 
        People fought back and kicked out their corrupt government and now, they celebrate 9 years of autonomy.
        Today, people celebrate peace and continue to fight for indigenous rights.

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
        According to the 2015 census, an estimate of 141,177 Michoacanos speak Purepecha of the 4.5 million that live in the state of Michoacan.
        Opression was one of the main reasons why Purepecha was vanishing, but now, there is no excuse. 
        Being able to connect with the Purepecha culture and being able to embrace it gives the Purepecha culture valor.
        People have to stand up for what's right.      
        Learn Purepecha, find your voice.

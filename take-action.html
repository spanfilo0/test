        <h2>Find Your Voice</h2>
        <p>
          Purepecha is one out of the many indigenous languages throughout the world that has been silenced.
          People throughout the nation have become ashamed of their language and traditions.
          It is time to break that silence and recognize our roots.
          Being able to connect with your culture is what keeps your culture alive.
          People have to acknowledge other cultures and standing up against opression.
          Purepecha is part of my culture and by identifying with it, I give courage to the opressed to speak.
